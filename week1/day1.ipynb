    "Let's build a useful LLM solution - in a matter of minutes.\n",

    "By the end of this course, you will have built an autonomous Agentic AI solution with 7 agents that collaborate to solve a business problem. All in good time! We will start with something smaller...\n",

    "Our goal is to code a new kind of Web Browser. Give it a URL, and it will respond with a summary. The Reader's Digest of the internet!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, you should have completed the setup for [PC](../SETUP-PC.md) or [Mac](../SETUP-mac.md) and you hopefully launched this jupyter lab from within the project root directory, with your environment activated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## If you're new to Jupyter Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the wonderful world of Data Science experimentation! Once you've used Jupyter Lab, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it. Simply click in each \"cell\" with code in it, such as the cell immediately below this text, and hit Shift+Return to execute that cell. As you wish, you can add a cell with the + button in the toolbar, and print values of variables, or try out variations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I've written a notebook called [Guide to Jupyter](Guide%20to%20Jupyter.ipynb) to help you get more familiar with Jupyter Labs, including adding Markdown comments, using `!` to run shell commands, and `tqdm` to show progress.\n",

    "If you'd prefer to work in VSCode, [here](https://chatgpt.com/share/676f2e19-c228-8012-9911-6ca42f8ed766) are instructions from an AI friend on how to configure it for the course.\n",

Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",

      "Creating a website that securely handles and saves customer credit card information involves several technical, legal, and usability considerations. Below is a detailed step-by-step guide for a service-based business looking to develop such a system:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 1: Define Requirements and Compliance\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Understand the Business Model**:\n",
      "   - Determine what services will be offered, how payments will be processed, and how credit card information needs to be stored.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Legal and Compliance**:\n",
      "   - **PCI DSS Compliance**: If you're storing, processing, or transmitting cardholder data, you must comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Familiarize yourself with these requirements.\n",
      "   - **Data Protection Regulations**: Understand regulations such as GDPR or CCPA that could affect how you handle personal data.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Choose the Right Payment Gateway\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Identify Payment Gateways**:\n",
      "   - Research various payment processors (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, Square) that offer secure payment solutions and features like tokenization or vault services for saving payment information.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evaluate Features**:\n",
      "   - Opt for a gateway that provides tokenization, which allows you to store tokens (rather than actual card details) that can be used for transactions without exposing sensitive data.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Plan the Website Architecture\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Select a Technology Stack**:\n",
      "   - Choose a tech stack for your website (e.g., MERN stack, LAMP stack, or a content management system like WordPress for simpler deployments).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Design a Security Architecture**:\n",
      "   - Implement HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.\n",
      "   - Use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect against common threats.\n",
      "   - Create a secure database to store non-sensitive user information and payment tokens.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Develop the Website\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Frontend Development**:\n",
      "   - Create a user-friendly interface for customers to enter and save their payment information. \n",
      "   - Use responsive design to ensure ease of use on all devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Backend Development**:\n",
      "   - Integrate the payment gateway's API (e.g., Stripe‚Äôs API) to handle processing payments and storing tokens securely.\n",
      "   - Implement user authentication (consider using OAuth for higher security) and session management.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Database Design**:\n",
      "   - Design a database schema to store user profiles, transaction history, and payment tokens securely. Encrypt sensitive fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Implement Security Measures**:\n",
      "   - Utilize input validation to avoid SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).\n",
      "   - Store passwords using strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) and enforce strong password policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 5: Testing and Validation\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Functionality Testing**:\n",
      "   - Test payment flows to ensure that transactions, tokenization, and retrieval of stored payment methods work as intended.\n",

       "\"Creating a website that securely handles and saves customer credit card information involves several technical, legal, and usability considerations. Below is a detailed step-by-step guide for a service-based business looking to develop such a system:\\n\\n### Step 1: Define Requirements and Compliance\\n\\n1. **Understand the Business Model**:\\n   - Determine what services will be offered, how payments will be processed, and how credit card information needs to be stored.\\n\\n2. **Legal and Compliance**:\\n   - **PCI DSS Compliance**: If you're storing, processing, or transmitting cardholder data, you must comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Familiarize yourself with these requirements.\\n   - **Data Protection Regulations**: Understand regulations such as GDPR or CCPA that could affect how you handle personal data.\\n\\n### Step 2: Choose the Right Payment Gateway\\n\\n1. **Identify Payment Gateways**:\\n   - Research various payment processors (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, Square) that offer secure payment solutions and features like tokenization or vault services for saving payment information.\\n\\n2. **Evaluate Features**:\\n   - Opt for a gateway that provides tokenization, which allows you to store tokens (rather than actual card details) that can be used for transactions without exposing sensitive data.\\n\\n### Step 3: Plan the Website Architecture\\n\\n1. **Select a Technology Stack**:\\n   - Choose a tech stack for your website (e.g., MERN stack, LAMP stack, or a content management system like WordPress for simpler deployments).\\n\\n2. **Design a Security Architecture**:\\n   - Implement HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.\\n   - Use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect against common threats.\\n   - Create a secure database to store non-sensitive user information and payment tokens.\\n\\n### Step 4: Develop the Website\\n\\n1. **Frontend Development**:\\n   - Create a user-friendly interface for customers to enter and save their payment information. \\n   - Use responsive design to ensure ease of use on all devices.\\n\\n2. **Backend Development**:\\n   - Integrate the payment gateway's API (e.g., Stripe‚Äôs API) to handle processing payments and storing tokens securely.\\n   - Implement user authentication (consider using OAuth for higher security) and session management.\\n\\n3. **Database Design**:\\n   - Design a database schema to store user profiles, transaction history, and payment tokens securely. Encrypt sensitive fields.\\n\\n4. **Implement Security Measures**:\\n   - Utilize input validation to avoid SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).\\n   - Store passwords using strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) and enforce strong password policies.\\n\\n### Step 5: Testing and Validation\\n\\n1. **Functionality Testing**:\\n   - Test payment flows to ensure that transactions, tokenization, and retrieval of stored payment methods work as intended.\\n\\n2. **Security Testing**:\\n   - Conduct penetration testing and vulnerability assessments to identify and fix potential security gaps.\\n\\n3. **Compliance Testing**:\\n   - Ensure all processes comply with PCI DSS and relevant data protection laws. Consider seeking third-party audits to validate compliance.\\n\\n### Step 6: Launch and Monitor\\n\\n1. **Deployment**:\\n   - Deploy your website to a secure hosting environment.
